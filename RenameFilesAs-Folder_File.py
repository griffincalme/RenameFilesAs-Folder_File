# This program looks into a folder for any subfolders. It takes the name of each subfolder and inserts it into the beginning
# of each file's name within that subfolder, it then pulls the files out of the subfolder and deletes the subfolder.
# It was written to fix audiobooks that had each chapter as a folder but the files inside the chapter had non-descript naming.
# Now I can seamlessly play my books without having to manually switch to the next folder and hit play!
